# Network Programming Final Assignment
This project was made by me and my friend: https://github.com/Stefsk-glitch
## Course Description
In this course we learned how to program a multi-threaded network application in Java, based on the principles of object-oriÃ«nted programming.
After handing in the code, we had an assessment with the teachers asking us questions about what we made.

## Project Description
- This project implements a simple client-server system for managing user logs.
- The server allows clients to connect, authenticate with a username and password, and perform actions such as adding, removing and showing logs associated with their username.
- User credentials are stored in a binary search tree, and logs are stored in a JSON file.
- The client application allows users to interact with the server through the console.

## Project Requirements
### Must Haves:
- Code language is Java.
- Network communication between 2 apps using sockets.
- Utilizes multiple threads in one application.
- Contains at least one of the following subjects:
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Collection Streams
  - Regulare Expressions
  - Writing a generic class

### Should Haves:
- Project is documented (e.g. diagrams).
- Bi-directional socketcommunication between two applications.
- The server is able to handle multiple connections at the same time.
- Socketcommunication is robust (e.g. correctly disconnecting).
- Using multi-threading to process a heavy workload.
- A usefull project.
