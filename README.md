## Project Description
This project implements a simple client-server system for managing user logs.
The server allows clients to connect, authenticate with a username and password, and perform actions such as adding, removing and showing logs associated with their username.
User credentials are stored in a binary search tree, and logs are stored in a JSON file.
The client application allows users to interact with the server through the console.
